CLT - Conditions 1, Independence Condition: Sampled observations must be independent. This is difficult to verify but is more likely if random sampling/assignment is used and if sampling without replacement n < 10% of the population
CLT - Conditions 2, Success-Failure Condition (Sample Size): There should be at least 10 expected successes and 10 expected failures in the observed sample
CLT - Conditions 3, Sample Size/Skew Condition (Distribution): Either the population distribution is normal or if the population distribution is skewed the sample size is large. Samples size must be (n>=30) to use normal distributions
CLT Success Failure Condition, when np ≥ 10 and n(1 − p) ≥ 10 which is called the success-failure condition. The larger the n the smaller the error

Python Confidence Interval, 45% of adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions. However this value was based on a sample so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population. The study reported a standard error of about 1.2% and a normal model may be used in this setting. Create a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of adults who live with one or more chronic conditions. cl_95 = norm.ppf(1-0.05/2) SE = 1.2 / 100 p = 45/100 up=p+cl_95*SE lo=p-cl_95*SE print(lo' - 'up)

p-value, We then use this test statistic to calculate the p-value the probability of observing data at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis as our current data set if thenull hypothesis were true
p-value, If the p-value is low (lower than the significance level α which is usually 5%) we say that it would be very unlikely to observe the data if the null hypothesis were true and hence reject H0.
p-value, If the p-value is high (higher than α) we say that it is likely to observe the data even if the null hypothesis were true and hence do not reject H0

Simple Random Sample, Randomly select cases from the population where there is no implied connection between the points that are selected
Stratified Sample, are made up of similar observations We take a simple random sample from each stratum
Cluster Sample, are usually not made up of homogeneous observations. We take a simple random sample of clusters and then sample all observations in that cluster. Usually preferred for economical reasons.
Multistage Sample, Clusters are usually not made up of homogeneous observations. We take a simple random sample of clusters and then take a simple random sample of observations from the sampled clusters
Placebo, fake treatment often used as the control group for medical studies
Placebo effect, experimental units showing improvement simply because they believe they are receiving a special treatment
Blinding, when experimental units do not know whether they are in the control or treatment group
Double-blind, when both the experimental units and the researchers who interact with the patients do not know who is in the control and who is in the treatment group
Difference observational studies and experiments, Most experiments use random assignment while observational studies do not
Law of large numbers, as more observations are collected the proportion of occurrences with a particular outcome p̂n converges to the probability of that outcome p

If 80% of the messages that the spam filter processes are spam what is the probability that a message that is not blocked is actually spam?
t – Distribution, When the sample size <= 30 and/or we dont know the variance/standard deviation of the population we can use the t-distribution instead of the z-distribution.
Degrees of Freedom, It is an adjustment to the sample size (df) = n- 1 for tdistribution The general idea is that we are estimating from a smaller sample about a large population and we don’t know the population variance/standard deviation so we use the sample variance/standard deviation. and estimate the error based on sample size.
t – Dist vs z – Dist, t-distribution enables us to use a small sample size (<=30)  The t-distribution has a larger margin of error  The t-distribution margin of error depends on the degrees of freedom (df)   Always centered at 0 (like the z-distribution)
