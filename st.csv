CLT - Conditions 1, Independence Condition: Sampled observations must be independent. This is difficult to verify but is more likely if random sampling/assignment is used and if sampling without replacement n < 10% of the population
CLT - Conditions 2, Success-Failure Condition (Sample Size): There should be at least 10 expected successes and 10 expected failures in the observed sample
CLT - Conditions 3, Sample Size/Skew Condition (Distribution): Either the population distribution is normal or if the population distribution is skewed the sample size is large. Samples size must be (n>=30) to use normal distributions
CLT Success Failure Condition, when np ≥ 10 and n(1 − p) ≥ 10 which is called the success-failure condition. The larger the n the smaller the error
Python CLT, n = 500  p = 0.75  SF1 = n*p  SF2 = n*(1- p)  if (SF1>=10) & (SF2>=10):  print('Success Failure Condition is Satisfied')  else:  print('No Success')
Python CLT Confidence Interval, 80% of students love the statistics course. 25 students are chosen at random. 95% of the sampled students would have a Phat between what value and what value?  p=0.8  n=25  SE = pow(p*(1-p)/n  1/2)  print('SE' SE)  SD = 2 #95%   print('Upper Limit'   p + (SD*SE))   print('Lower Limit'   p - (SD*SE))

Python Binomial, A rare disease affects 1 in 20000. In a random sample of 1000 what is the probability that exactly 2 have this disease?   k=2   n=1000   p=1/20000   print(binom.pmf(k n p))
Python Binomial, 7% of teenagers suffer from arachnophobia. 10 teenagers sleeping in each tent. Calculate the probability that exactly 2 of them suffer from arachnophobia. k=2  n=10   p=0.07   print(binom.pmf(k  n  p))

z-table, What percent of a standard normal distribution N(μ = 0 σ = 1) is found in each region?  Z <−1.35 = 0.0885     Z >1.48 = 1−0.9306 = 0.0694    −0.4<Z <1.5 = P(Z < 1.5)−P(Z < −0.4) = 0.9332−0.3446 = 0.5886
dice, If you roll a pair of fair dice what is the probability of getting a sum of 5?
Geometric distribution, describes the waiting time until a success for independent and identically distributed (iid) Bernoulli random variables. independence: outcomes of trials don't affect each other. identical: the probability of success is the same for each trial
Python Geometric Dist. Calculate the probability of rolling a 6 for the first time on the 6th roll of a die using the geometric distribution. (5/6)**5 * (1/6)  p=1/6  n=6  GD = ((1-p)**(n-1))*p   print(GD)     print(geom(p).pmf(n))

Python Negative Binomial Distribution, # Parameters  n = 3  # Number of failures   p = 0.4  # Success probability   # Calculate PMF for k successes    k = 5   probability = nbinom.pmf(k  n p)  print(probability)
Python Negative Binomial Distribution, p = 0.10 k = 10 n = 30 A college student working at a psychology lab is asked to recruit 10 couples to participate in a study. She decides to stand outside the student center and ask every 5th person leaving the building whether they are in a relationship and if so. whether they would like to participate in the study with their significant other. Suppose the probability of finding such a person is 10%. What is the probability that she will need to ask 30 people before she hits her goal?
Simple Random Sample, Randomly select cases from the population where there is no implied connection between the points that are selected
Stratified Sample, are made up of similar observations We take a simple random sample from each stratum
Cluster Sample, are usually not made up of homogeneous observations. We take a simple random sample of clusters and then sample all observations in that cluster. Usually preferred for economical reasons.
Multistage Sample, Clusters are usually not made up of homogeneous observations. We take a simple random sample of clusters and then take a simple random sample of observations from the sampled clusters
Placebo, fake treatment often used as the control group for medical studies
Placebo effect, experimental units showing improvement simply because they believe they are receiving a special treatment
Blinding, when experimental units do not know whether they are in the control or treatment group
Double-blind, when both the experimental units and the researchers who interact with the patients do not know who is in the control and who is in the treatment group
Difference observational studies and experiments, Most experiments use random assignment while observational studies do not
Law of large numbers, as more observations are collected the proportion of occurrences with a particular outcome p̂n converges to the probability of that outcome p
Cards, What is the probability of drawing a jack or a red card from a well shuffled full deck? 4/42 + 26/52 -2/52 = 28/52
